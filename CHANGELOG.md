# Changelog

Versions are git tags `v<semver>`, published to the npm registry by `release.yml`. A new Theme, Token or Slot
kind with an inert default is a minor; generated images are a patch; a renamed or removed Token, a changed
Slot treatment or a changed manifest shape is a major, recorded here.

## Unreleased

- `npm run theme-assets`: the development-time asset generation script, with its alpha check, backdrop
  luminance clamp, budgets and `provenance.json` (`dyeworks-provenance/1`). It is not part of the published
  package; `sharp` is a development dependency.

## 1.0.0

The first release for consumers.

- The Token contract (`tokens.json`, `dyeworks-tokens/1`) and `dist/tokens.css` with every default on `:root`.
- The Slot vocabulary (`slots.json`, `dyeworks-slots/1`) and the optional `slots.css`.
- The `default` Theme, light and dark, with inert decoration; `dist/themes.css`.
- `dyeworks/registry`: `themes` and `options()`, generated from the Theme directories.
- `dyeworks/chooser`: `createChooser({storageKey, registry, defaults?, mirrorKey?})`.
- `dyeworks/boot`: `bootScript({storageKey, mirrorKey?})`, the inline script applying the choice before the
  first paint.
- `dyeworks/react`: `ThemeMenu` and `IntensityControl`; `react` is an optional peer dependency.
- `dyeworks/contract-check`: `checkContract({stylesheets, tokenMap?, allow?})`.
- The `themes/` directory shipped for consumers to serve at `/themes/`.
